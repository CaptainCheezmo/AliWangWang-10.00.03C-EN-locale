# AliWangWang-10.00.03C-EN-locale
English translation files to override Simplified Chinese.
They're not perfect and there's a lot of overflow due to form sizing.

I use AliWangWang for my importing business and the new 10.00.03C update changed the entire client, so I ran the Simplified Chinese translation file through my own little auto-translator in Google Sheets as well as reverting source strings in Qt Linguist.
Files just need to be replaced into the translation folder under:

  %programfiles%\AliWangWang\10.00.03C\Resources\Translations\appts_zh_CN\
  
Make sure to back up the original folder just in case.
